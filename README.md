# _Entertainment Security_

#### By _**Tavish OKeefe**_

## Description

_This application will provide a fun way for clients to add security features to their devices._

_A user will be able to view a "screensaver" type page, with an image (which in the future, will be dynamic). On this page the user will need to click on a series of places (dynamic images and sounds in the future), in a certain order, to have access to the computer. [A series of clicks on the page, in a certain order, will allow the user to proceed.]

If the user clicks on the wrong places, or if the user clicks on the right places in the wrong order, a picture will be taken of the user. This image will be saved to an external database, which only the person who set up the application has access to, as well as locally on their device, for fun image manipulation with the application of the users choosing._
